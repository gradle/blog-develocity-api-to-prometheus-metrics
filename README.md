# ge-export-api-to-prometheus  

Sample code as a companion to Visualizing Gradle Enterprise Data with Prometheus and Grafana blog.
Follow the TODOs inside the code to update the app with your Gradle Enterprise Server URL and Access Key. Hint: Look in BuildScanServiceConfig.java

If you want to update the Prometheus PushGateway URL, check the TODO in PrometheusUtils.java

Build with:

```./gradlew clean build```

And use the distribution in ./build/distributions/

Or you can just run from IDE.
